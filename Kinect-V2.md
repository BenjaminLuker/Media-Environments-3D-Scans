# 3D Scanning with Kinect V2

## The Process
Scanning with the Kinect V2 is not particularly difficult. It just takes a bit of setup and a particular environment. In order to 3D scan someone using the Kinect V2, all one needs to do is install the (free) Microsoft application 3D Builder. Once inside the program you need to go to the insert tab, hit add, and hit scan on the bottom left. This brings up a fairly user friendly interface where you define the boundaries of your scan and how far away your subject is from the camera. You will know you've done everything correctly if you subject is colored in the box while the background and anything else you do not want to scan are in greyscale. Hit scan and slowly rotate your subject for as long as possible to get the best results. 

## The Pros
* It is very easy to scan someone and produce a model.
* Scans come with color information.
* The Kinect V2 does a pretty good job at accurately capturing a figure. 

## The Cons
* It requires the object move instead of the scanner, which can be tricky considering the object simultaniously needs to stand in place.
* It does not do a great job at capturing detail and scans look very bad up close.
* It's very easy to mess up the scan and have to start over.
